    "There are N students in a class. Some of them are friends, while some are not. Their friendship is transitive in nature. Find the number of friend circles among all the students.\n",
    "- Q3: Redundant Connection.\n",
    "In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles. The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes.\n",
